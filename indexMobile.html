                        <h2><span>&raquo;About The QUEST COIN distribution:</span></h2>
                        <p>Connecting to deeptown pool......success</p>
                        <p>Our take on fair crypto distribution
                           Our distribution model provides unique experience for the crypto community. 
                           First time in history of crypto (okay maybe second) coins are distributed
                           based not on wealth but rather intellect and commitment. <br>
                           Modern-day crypto distribution: Modern-day crypto distribution may be tricky. With bitcoin distribution financial incentive was relatively vague 
                           with distribution being more about ​​​​​​​ideology.​​​​​​​ Most popular distribution types today - ICO (pre-ICO’s, pre-pre-ICO’s etc.) private sales etc are hard to
                           distribute fair. Greed joins the equation even before the project outlined it’s idea and progress. Proof-of-Work and staking and other more “classic”
                           ways of distribution require quite a financial investment - you need equipment/stake for having a chance of solving puzzles and receive rewards. 
                           Which leaves us with Airdrops, faucets and other ways of distributing ‘free’ money, although they create liquidity and can act as a promotional 
                           tool it does not necessarily build a relationship with holder. Easy to get and most likely to be forgotten about after selling it. <br>
                           Our take on it: Not everyone can invest financially so thats why we want our users to invest intellectually. 
                           we want players to build connections with won coins and set value on them from earned sense of achievement.
                           Those are the reasons why we choose quest distribution as our first source of emission. <br>
                           We currently using Ethereum blockchain as our distribution platform
                           for ​​​​​​​next reasons - proven by time, developer friendly​​​​​​​, big community. 
                           In a comparison of ​​​​​​​token to coins,​​​​​​​ many may see tokens as  
                           flawed, we see it as our strong point - we always can migrate 
                           to a public ledger that is easily retrievable.<br>
                           Possible problems:<br>
                           1) Probably biggest issue that may arise is
                           lack of transparency while solving quests.
                           And possibility of devs doing so - so we implement 
                           karma system and social rewards!
                           If you solved the quest just do a public post
                           on any big social network and receive up to x2
                           of your initial reward plus karma!
                           2) Other possibility is that we encounter a superior 
                           human intellect that can solve any puzzle we can offer.
                           In that case we will do everything in our
                           power to interact with that individual and make
                           him part of our team, thus creating superior quests 
                           for everyone else. That’s why we introduce our CREATOR
                           program where quest creators can make money and 
                           gain respected position in DeepWeaver Universes.<br>
                           The Creators:<br>
                           Good at solving or creating quest? You’ve come to the right place!
                           We want to imprint as much talent on blockchain as we can -
                           Creating quests is not only about ​​​​​​​difficulty (that too of course), 
                           but also ​​​​​​ about fun! And while we developing tools that help storytellers 
                           communicate with their audience is such ways, we encourage 
                           community creativity and work. Show us what you can do and 
                           Become our STAR Creator and forever lock your name in 
                           the history of many many virtual worlds(while getting paid).

                           AID system requires dev to announce mining process
                           on blockchain 86400 blocks (around 15 days) before
                           the minting itself thus protecting investors 
                           from instant dumps.
                           Our emission model is devided onto three parts in
                           our smart contract. On first stage social rewards are

                           When designing a crypto project developers
                           need to take into consideration needs of all
                           participants of the market - devs, traders, miners, 
                           and esp. users and players/gamers.
                           At least we started like that.messyd3

                           atomic swaps, VR worlds can interact with each other
                           freely while being on different blockchains. <br>
                           We are very excited for our land auctions and other city
                           planning distribution events. Virtual city building is new and
                           many ​​​​​​​unknowns may arise ​​​​​​​that's​​​​​​​ why we are having multiple
                           test worlds at the beginning of the project. 
                           A real worlds city planner is onboard with us, so anyway
                           it's gonna be gud, fun and interesting to say the least.<br>

                           Deepweaver take storytelling very ​​​​​​​serious. That's why every 
                           new universe created at our platform that receives our ​​​​​​​official 
                           support requires its own set of rules. Everything from species 
                           and color of the sky to the number of dimensions and 
                           interstellar travel or even time-shifting possibility. ​​​​​​​
